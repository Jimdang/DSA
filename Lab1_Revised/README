Review of Java Language
In this lab you will implement a program that processes the log file for the bowling sport. First,
let us review the rules for the bowling sport.
Bowling Sport Scoring Rules:
In an open frame, a bowler simply gets credit for the number of pins knocked down. In the case
of a spare, a slash mark is recorded in a small square in the upper right-hand corner of that frame
on the score sheet, and no score is entered until the first ball of the next frame is rolled.
Then credit is given for 10 plus the number of pins knocked down with that next ball. For
example, a player rolls a spare in the first frame; with the first ball of the second frame, the
player knocks down seven pins. The first frame, then, gets 17 points. If two of the remaining
three pins get knocked down, 9 pins are added, for a total of 26 in the second frame.
If a bowler gets a strike, it is recorded with an X in the small square, the score being 10 plus the
total number of pins knocked down in the next two rolls. Thus, the bowler who rolls three strikes
in a row in the first three frames gets credit for 30 points in the first frame.
A perfect score in bowling is a 300 game, represents 12 strikes in a row--a total of 120 pins
knocked down. Why 12 strikes, instead of 10? Because, if a bowler gets a strike in the last frame,
the score for that frame can't be recorded before rolling twice more. Similarly, if a bowler rolls a
spare in the last frame, one more roll is required before the final score can be tallied.
Bowling Log File Format:
Your assignment will be to process the bowling log file which contains information about the
player scores, etc. Specifically, the bowling log file contains the following information:
• First line contains one value
o N – the number players, a value between 1 and 6
• Each subsequent line contains N player entries
• Player entry consists of the bowling frame for the player
• The frame is placed in square brackets and is represented as a sequence of pin values
separated by a comma.
• The pin values are represented as a string that consists of one part:
o Pin value: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, /, X

Here is a sample file:
2
[1, /] [2, 4]
[0, /] [3, /]
[2, /] [4, 4]
[3, /] [8, /]
[1, /] [5, 4]
[6, /] [6, /]
[3, /] [3, 4]
[9, /] [9, /]
[1, /] [1, 4]
[8, /, 6] [3, /, 9]

Lab Assignment:
Write a Java program that processes the log file and displays the following information:
• For each player display:
o Their score
o How many times the player got a spare
o How many times the player got a strike
Your program should also report syntax errors in the log file. You can assume that there are only
the following types of errors:
1. The number of players (N) in the first line is incorrect
2. The read pin value is incorrect
3. The number of players in one of the subsequent lines is not equal to the initial number of
players specified in the first line
In case of the log file errors (1) (i.e. error in the first line) the program should gracefully
terminate and display the reason for termination. In case of log file errors (2) or (3) (i.e. errors in
subsequent lines) the program should display an error message stating the type of error (e.g. 10 is
an unknown pin value or too few players), skip the line with an error and continue on with the
processing of the file.
Create several log files (you want to create log files with errors) and then test your
implementation against created log files.
Hint: Make sure that your implementation is easily upgradable. I would suggest that you create
several classes!
What to submit:
• Lab report front page
• Complete implementation of the program (all classes). Your code must follow the Java
Style Guide. YOUR CODE MUST COMPILE!!!
• Log files tested, each followed by the program output
